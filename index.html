          Advice 1 from Lex Friedman: listen to your inner voice, ignore the gradient.
        </p>
        <p>
          The voices around you will want you to follow the gradient to the local optimum. Listen just long enough to learn and short enough to ignore them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When your confidence first increases from nothing, your confidence will quickly increases to a peak. You'd think you know a lot and feel extremely confident in yourself. As your competence keep increasing, you will experience a valley of despire, where your confidence drops very low. After that, you will make progress slowly, which will bring your confidence back up bit by bit, intil you reach a local optimum point. This is the point where your parents, friends, the society, and your advisors want you to stay, because it is safe, and it seems like success. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you just keep going, and ignore those voices that tell you to stop progressing, you are walking forward with the sound of disapproval. Maybe even hatred, from people who are nasty about your success. These might crash your confidence once again. But eventually, if you just stick to it, and keep progressing, improving, and learning, you will reach your dream. This dream will bring you the kind of confidence and happiness that you experience for the first time in your entire journey of learning. 
        </p>
        <p>
          THAT, IS YOUR INNER VOICE.

          Advice 2 from Lex Friedman: Carve your own path - take the detour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your path of reaching your dream is not going to be the same as others. Do it as a way of living. Do it in a way that you would enjoy. It will be different, unique. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My detours are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Martial arts</li>
          <li>Running</li>
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Japanese</li>
          <li>Music</li>

          Advice 2 from Lex Friedman: Measure passion, not progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Passion:</strong> Measure # of days of unwavering passion for the dream - how many of the 27,375 days were filled with fire?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ignore progress:</strong> Visualize the optimum, and the space-time continuum will distort to reveal the obvious next step to take
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>WARNING:</strong> The people who love you, who care for you will not help in your pursue of your passion. Take their love, not their advice. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Parents and significant others will tell you to find a secure job, because passion looks dangerous.</li>
          <li>Advisors and colleagues will tell you to be pragmatic, because passion looks like a distraction from what should be the main effort.</li>
          <li>Society will tell you to find balance, because passion looks unhealthy.</li>
        </ul>

          Advice 4 from Lex Friedman: Word hard, form a habit of daily deep work
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Put in the hours, every day, for years.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Work Smart:</strong> It takes thousands of hours of hard work and countless failures to learn how to "work smart". Hard work is not measured in hours of being busy, but in hours of deep work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Stress:</strong> Seek to minimize stress, not minimize work. Best cure for stress is to love what you do.
